insert(self, val): insert val into BST, if val is already there, ignore insertion.
search(self, val): return the NODE containing that val. Else: None
size(self): return the int size of the BST. (= total # of nodes in tree, 0 if None)
depth(self): return int representation of the depth (# of levels) of the tree - root level is depth 0
contains(self, val): bool result for if val is in the tree.
balance(self): return an int (pos/neg) showing balance of the tree. Left weighted tree is positive, right weighted tree is negative.

Takes an iterable on init.
