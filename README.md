Non-paired data structures work

quick sort:
At its very worst case quick sort is an O(n^2) operation.  Worst case would be a list that was already sorted.  This would make the sort go through every item a number of times equal to the size of the list.
On average (according to wikipedia) quick sort would take O(n log n) to sort.  This would be that as it moves through the list it breaks the list down into 2 halves and sorts each of those separately.
