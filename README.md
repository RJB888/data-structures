# data-structures
Non-paired data structures work

O(n^2) is still worst case scenario here as well. If a reverse-ordered list is fed into this, it still has to iterate through the whole list for each item in the list.

Absolute best case scenario would be O(n).  This only happens when the list is already sorted and you add something that is the largest in the list.
